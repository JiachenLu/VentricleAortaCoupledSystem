# VentricleAortaCoupledSystem

1. Computes a coupled left ventricle/aorta model system 
2. The left ventricle is an axisymmetric biomechanical model
3. The aorta is a 1D arterial wave propagation model
4. The system is terminated at both ends by lumped parameter models for 
   the remainder of the circulation
